## Summary Of Each Service
### EC2

> Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing
> capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. Using Amazon EC2
> eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can
> develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to
> launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure
> security and networking, and manage storage. Amazon EC2 enables you to
> scale up or down to handle changes in requirements or spikes in
> popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic.

### ECS

> Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. Amazon ECS lets you launch and stop container-based applications with simple API calls, allows you to get the state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features.

### Lightsail

> Virtual private servers made easy.

### Elastic Beanstalk

> Amazon Web Services (AWS) comprises dozens of services, each of which exposes an area of functionality. While the variety of services offers flexibility for how you want to manage your AWS infrastructure, it can be challenging to figure out which services to use and how to provision them.
> 
> With Elastic Beanstalk, you can quickly deploy and manage applications
> in the AWS Cloud without worrying about the infrastructure that runs
> those applications. AWS Elastic Beanstalk reduces management
> complexity without restricting choice or control. You simply upload
> your application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the
> details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and
> application health monitoring. Elastic Beanstalk uses highly reliable
> and scalable services that are available in the AWS Free Usage Tier.
> 
> Elastic Beanstalk supports applications developed in Java, PHP, .NET,
> Node.js, Python, and Ruby, as well as different container types for
> each language. A container defines the infrastructure and software
> stack to be used for a given environment. When you deploy your
> application, Elastic Beanstalk provisions one or more AWS resources,
> such as Amazon EC2 instances. The software stack that runs on your
> Amazon EC2 instances depends on the container type. For example,
> Elastic Beanstalk supports two container types for Node.js: a 32-bit
> Amazon Linux image and a 64-bit Amazon Linux image. Each runs a
> software stack tailored to hosting a Node.js application. You can
> interact with Elastic Beanstalk by using the AWS Management Console,
> the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or eb, a high-level CLI
> designed specifically for Elastic Beanstalk.

### Lambda

> AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. AWS Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running. With AWS Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration. AWS Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging. All you need to do is supply your code in one of the languages that AWS Lambda supports (currently Node.js, Java, C# and Python).

### Batch

> AWS Batch enables you to run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud. Batch computing is a common way for developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources, and AWS Batch removes the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing the required infrastructure. AWS Batch is similar to traditional batch computing software. This service can efficiently provision resources in response to jobs submitted in order to eliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver results quickly.
> 
> As a fully managed service, AWS Batch enables developers, scientists, and engineers to run batch computing workloads of any scale. AWS Batch automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes the workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of the workloads. With AWS Batch, there is no need to install or manage batch computing software, which allows you to focus on analyzing results and solving problems. AWS Batch reduces operational complexities, saves time, and reduces costs, which makes it easy for developers, scientists, and engineers to run their batch jobs in the AWS Cloud.

### Auto Scaling

> Auto Scaling helps you ensure that you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances available to handle the load for your application. You create collections of EC2 instances, called Auto Scaling groups. You can specify the minimum number of instances in each Auto Scaling group, and Auto Scaling ensures that your group never goes below this size. You can specify the maximum number of instances in each Auto Scaling group, and Auto Scaling ensures that your group never goes above this size. If you specify the desired capacity, either when you create the group or at any time thereafter, Auto Scaling ensures that your group has this many instances. If you specify scaling policies, then Auto Scaling can launch or terminate instances as demand on your application increases or decreases.

###[Elastic Load Balancing][1]

> Elastic Load Balancing supports three types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers. This guide discusses Application Load Balancers. For more information about Network Load Balancers, see the User Guide for [Network Load Balancers][2]. For more information about Classic Load Balancers, see the User Guide for [Classic Load Balancers][3].
> 
Application Load Balancer Overview
> 
> An Application Load Balancer functions at the application layer, the seventh layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. After the load balancer receives a request, it evaluates the listener rules in priority order to determine which rule to apply, and then selects a target from the target group for the rule action using the round robin routing algorithm. Note that you can configure listener rules to route requests to different target groups based on the content of the application traffic. Routing is performed independently for each target group, even when a target is registered with multiple target groups.

###[EC2 Container Registry][4]

> Amazon EC2 Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a managed AWS Docker registry service that is secure, scalable, and reliable. Amazon ECR supports private Docker repositories with resource-based permissions using AWS IAM so that specific users or Amazon EC2 instances can access repositories and images. Developers can use the Docker CLI to push, pull, and manage images.

###[S3][5]

>Amazon Simple Storage Service is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.
> 
> Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites. The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to developers.

###[Elastic Block Store][6]

> Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes are highly available and reliable storage volumes that can be attached to any running instance that is in the same Availability Zone. EBS volumes that are attached to an EC2 instance are exposed as storage volumes that persist independently from the life of the instance. With Amazon EBS, you pay only for what you use. For more information about Amazon EBS pricing, see the Projecting Costs section of the [Amazon Elastic Block Store page][7].
> 
> Amazon EBS is recommended when data must be quickly accessible and requires long-term persistence. EBS volumes are particularly well-suited for use as the primary storage for file systems, databases, or for any applications that require fine granular updates and access to raw, unformatted, block-level storage. Amazon EBS is well suited to both database-style applications that rely on random reads and writes, and to throughput-intensive applications that perform long, continuous reads and writes.

 ###[Elastic File System][8]

 

> Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides simple, scalable file storage for use with Amazon EC2. With Amazon EFS, storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files, so your applications have the storage they need, when they need it.
> 
> Amazon EFS has a simple web services interface that allows you to create and configure file systems quickly and easily. The service manages all the file storage infrastructure for you, avoiding the complexity of deploying, patching, and maintaining complex file system deployments.
> 
> Amazon EFS supports the Network File System versions 4.0 and 4.1 (NFSv4) protocol, so the applications and tools that you use today work seamlessly with Amazon EFS. Multiple Amazon EC2 instances can access an Amazon EFS file system at the same time, providing a common data source for workloads and applications running on more than one instance or server.

> With Amazon EFS, you pay only for the storage used by your file system. You don't need to provision storage in advance and there is no minimum fee or setup cost. For more information, see [Amazon EFS Pricing][9].

> The service is designed to be highly scalable, highly available, and highly durable. Amazon EFS file systems store data and metadata across multiple Availability Zones in a region and can grow to petabyte scale, drive high levels of throughput, and allow massively parallel access from Amazon EC2 instances to your data.

###[Amazon Glacier][10]

> Amazon Glacier is an extremely low-cost storage service that provides durable storage with security features for data archiving and backup. With Amazon Glacier, customers can store their data cost effectively for months, years, or even decades. Amazon Glacier enables customers to offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling storage to AWS, so they don't have to worry about capacity planning, hardware provisioning, data replication, hardware failure detection and recovery, or time-consuming hardware migrations. For more service highlights and pricing information, go to the [Amazon Glacier detail page][11].

###[Snowball][12]

> AWS Snowball is a service that accelerates transferring large amounts of data into and out of AWS using physical storage appliances, bypassing the Internet. Each AWS Snowball appliance type can transport data at faster-than internet speeds. This transport is done by shipping the data in the appliances through a regional carrier. The appliances are rugged shipping containers, complete with E Ink shipping labels.

> With a Snowball, you can transfer hundreds of terabytes or petabytes of data between your on-premises data centers and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). AWS Snowball uses Snowball appliances and provides powerful interfaces that you can use to create jobs, transfer data, and track the status of your jobs through to completion. By shipping your data in Snowballs, you can transfer large amounts of data at a significantly faster rate than if you were transferring that data over the Internet, saving you time and money.

###[AWS Storage Gateway][13]

> AWS Storage Gateway connects an on-premises software appliance with cloud-based storage to provide seamless integration with data security features between your on-premises IT environment and the Amazon Web Services (AWS) storage infrastructure. You can use the service to store data in the AWS Cloud for scalable and cost-effective storage that helps maintain data security. AWS Storage Gateway offers file-based, volume-based and tape-based storage solutions:
> 
 File Gateway – File gateway is a type of AWS Storage Gateway that supports a file interface into Amazon S3 and that adds to the current block-based volume and VTL storage. File gateway combines a service and virtual software appliance, enabling you to store and retrieve objects in Amazon S3 using industry-standard file protocols such as Network File System (NFS). The software appliance, or gateway, is deployed into your on-premises environment as a virtual machine (VM) running on VMware ESXi. The gateway provides access to objects in S3 as files on a NFS mount point.
With file gateway, you can do the following:
 - You can now store and retrieve files directly using NFS 3 or 4.1 protocol.
 - You can access your data directly in S3 from any cloud application or service.
 - You can manage your data directly in Amazon S3 using lifecycle policies, cross-region replication, and versioning. We refer to this new capability as file gateway. You can think of this as an NFS mount on S3.
> 
> File gateway simplifies file storage in Amazon S3, integrates to existing applications through industry standard file system protocols and provides a cost-effective alternative to on-premises storage. It also provides low-latency access to data through transparent local caching. File gateway manages data transfer to and from AWS, buffers applications from network congestion, optimizes and streams data in parallel, and manages bandwidth consumption. File gateway integrates with the AWS platform. For example, it integrates AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to provide common access management, encryption using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), monitoring using Amazon CloudWatch (CloudWatch), audit using AWS CloudTrail (CloudTrail), operations using the AWS Management Console and AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), billing and cost management, and data management using S3 lifecycle policies and cross-region replication.
> 
> Volume Gateway – Volume gateway provides cloud-backed storage volumes that you can mount as Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) devices from your on-premises application servers. The gateway supports the following volume configurations:
 - Cached Volumes – You store your data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and retain a copy of frequently accessed data subsets locally. Cached volumes offer a substantial cost savings on primary storage and minimize the need to scale your storage on-premises. You also retain low-latency access to your frequently accessed data.
 - Stored Volumes – If you need low-latency access to your entire data set, you can configure your on-premises gateway to store all your data locally and then asynchronously back up point-in-time snapshots of this data to Amazon S3. This configuration provides durable and inexpensive off-site backups that you can recover to your local data center or Amazon EC2. For example, if you need replacement capacity for disaster recovery, you can recover the backups to Amazon EC2.
> 
> Tape Gateway – You can cost-effectively and durably archive backup data in Amazon Glacier. Tape Gateway provides a virtual tape infrastructure that scales seamlessly with your business needs and eliminates the operational burden of provisioning, scaling, and maintaining a physical tape infrastructure.

###[Relational Database Service][14]

> Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks.
> 
> Why would you want a managed relational database service? Because Amazon RDS takes over many of the difficult or tedious management tasks of a relational database.
> 
 - When you buy a server, you get CPU, memory, storage, and IOPS, all bundled together. With Amazon RDS, these are split apart so that you can scale them independently. So, for example, if you need more CPU, less IOPS, or more storage, you can easily allocate them.
 - Amazon RDS manages backups, software patching, automatic failure detection, and recovery.
 - In order to deliver a managed service experience, Amazon RDS does not provide shell access to DB instances, and it restricts access to certain system procedures and tables that require advanced privileges.
 - You can have automated backups performed when you need them, or create your own backup snapshot. These backups can be used to restore a database, and the Amazon RDS restore process works reliably and efficiently.
 - You can get high availability with a primary instance and a synchronous secondary instance that you can failover to when problems occur. You can also use MySQL, MariaDB, or PostgreSQL Read Replicas to increase read scaling.
 - You can use the database products you are already familiar with: MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and the new, MySQL-compatible Amazon Aurora DB engine (for information, see [Aurora on Amazon RDS][15]).
 - In addition to the security in your database package, you can help control who can access your RDS databases by using AWS IAM to define users and permissions. You can also help protect your databases by putting them in a virtual private cloud.
 
###[DynamoDB][16]
> 
> Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. DynamoDB lets you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed database, so that you don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling.
> With DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. You can scale up or scale down your tables' throughput capacity without downtime or performance degradation, and use the AWS Management Console to monitor resource utilization and performance metrics.
> DynamoDB allows you to delete expired items from tables automatically to help you reduce storage usage and the cost of storing data that is no longer relevant. For more information, see [Time To Live][17].
> DynamoDB automatically spreads the data and traffic for your tables over a sufficient number of servers to handle your throughput and storage requirements, while maintaining consistent and fast performance. All of your data is stored on solid state disks (SSDs) and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones in an AWS region, providing built-in high availability and data durability.

###[ElastiCache][18]

> ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to set up, manage, and scale a distributed in-memory cache environment in the cloud. It provides a high-performance, scalable, and cost-effective caching solution, while removing the complexity associated with deploying and managing a distributed cache environment.

> With ElastiCache, you can quickly deploy your cache environment, without having to provision hardware or install software. You can choose from Memcached or Redis protocol-compliant cache engine software, and let ElastiCache perform software upgrades and patch management for you. For enhanced security, ElastiCache can be run in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) environment, giving you complete control over network access to your clusters. With just a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, you can add or remove resources such as nodes, clusters, or read replicas to your ElastiCache environment to meet your business needs and application requirements.

> Existing applications that use Memcached or Redis can use ElastiCache with almost no modification. Your applications simply need to know the host names and port numbers of the ElastiCache nodes that you have deployed. The ElastiCache Auto Discovery feature for Memcached lets your applications identify all of the nodes in a cache cluster and connect to them, rather than having to maintain a list of available host names and port numbers. In this way, your applications are effectively insulated from changes to node membership in a cluster.

###[Redshift][19]

> Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud. An Amazon Redshift data warehouse is a collection of computing resources called nodes, which are organized into a group called a cluster. Each cluster runs an Amazon Redshift engine and contains one or more databases.

###[VPC][20]


> Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources into a virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

###[CloudFront][21]

> Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .php, and image files, to your users. CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. When a user requests content that you're serving with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance. If the content is already in the edge location with the lowest latency, CloudFront delivers it immediately. If the content is not in that edge location, CloudFront retrieves it from an Amazon S3 bucket or an HTTP server (for example, a web server) that you have identified as the source for the definitive version of your content.

###[Direct Connect][22]

> AWS Direct Connect links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location over a standard 1-gigabit or 10-gigabit Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an AWS Direct Connect router. With this connection in place, you can create virtual interfaces directly to public AWS services (for example, to Amazon S3) or to Amazon VPC, bypassing Internet service providers in your network path. An AWS Direct Connect location provides access to AWS in the region with which it is associated. You can provision a single connection to any AWS Direct Connect location in North America and use it to access public AWS services in all North America regions and AWS GovCloud (US).

###[Route 53][24]

> You can use Amazon Route 53 to help you get a website or web application up and running. Amazon Route 53 performs three main functions:
> 
> - Register domain names – Your website needs a name, such as example.com. Amazon Route 53 lets you register a name for your website or web application, known as a domain name. For an overview, see [How Domain Registration Works][25].
- Route internet traffic to the resources for your domain – When a user opens a web browser and enters your domain name in the address bar, Amazon Route 53 helps the Domain Name System (DNS) connect the browser with your website or web application. For an overview, see [How Internet Traffic Is Routed to Your Website or Web Application][26].
- Check the health of your resources – Amazon Route 53 sends automated requests over the internet to a resource, such as a web server, to verify that it's reachable, available, and functional. You also can choose to receive notifications when a resource becomes unavailable and choose to route internet traffic away from unhealthy resources. For an overview, see [How Amazon Route 53 Checks the Health of Your Resources][27].

###[Application Discovery Service][28]

> AWS Application Discovery Service collects and presents data to enable enterprise customers to understand the configuration, usage, and behavior of servers in their on-premises environment. Server data is stored securely by the service, where it can be tagged and grouped into applications to help with AWS migration planning. The data can be exported for analysis in Excel or other cloud migration analysis tools. For more information, see [AWS Application Discovery Service FAQ][29].
> 
> Application Discovery Service offers two modes of operation:
> 
> - Agentless discovery mode is recommended for environments that use VMware vCenter Server. This mode doesn't require you to install an agent on each host. Agentless discovery gathers server information regardless of the operating systems, which minimizes the time required for initial on-premises infrastructure assessment. Agentless discovery doesn't collect information about software and software dependencies. It also doesn't work in non-VMware environments.
- Agent-based discovery mode collects a richer set of data than agentless discovery by using Amazon software, the AWS Application Discovery Agent, which you install on one or more hosts in your data center. The agent captures infrastructure and application information, including an inventory of installed software applications, system and process performance, resource utilization, and network dependencies between workloads. The information collected by agents is secured at rest and in transit to the Application Discovery Service database in the cloud. Agent-based discovery works in both VMware and non-virtualized environments.
> 
> We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware environments and to collect information about software and software dependencies. You can also run agent-based and agentless discovery simultaneously. Use agentless discovery to quickly complete the initial infrastructure assessment and then install agents on select hosts.

###[Database Migration Service][30]

> AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) can migrate your data to and from most widely used commercial and open-source databases such as Oracle, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Aurora, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon S3, MariaDB, and MySQL. The service supports homogeneous migrations such as Oracle to Oracle, and also heterogeneous migrations between different database platforms, such as Oracle to MySQL or MySQL to Amazon Aurora. The source or target database must be on an AWS service.
> 
> To perform a database migration, AWS DMS connects to the source database, reads the source data, formats the data for consumption by the target database, and loads the data into the target database. Most of this processing happens in memory, though large transactions might require some buffering to disk. Cached transactions and log files are also written to disk.
> 
> AWS DMS creates the target schema objects necessary to perform the migration. However, AWS DMS takes a minimalist approach and creates only those objects required to efficiently migrate the data. In other words, AWS DMS creates tables, primary keys, and in some cases unique indexes, but it doesn't create any other objects that are not required to efficiently migrate the data from the source. For example, it doesn't create secondary indexes, non-primary key constraints, or data defaults.
> 
> In most cases, when performing a migration, you will also want to migrate most or all of the source schema. If you are performing a homogeneous migration (between two databases of the same engine type), you migrate the schema by using your engine’s native tools to export and import the schema itself, without any data. If your migration is heterogeneous (between two databases that use different engine types), you can use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool to generate a complete target schema for you. If you use the tool, any dependencies between tables such as foreign key constraints need to be disabled during the migration's "full load" and "cached change apply" phases. If performance is an issue, removing or disabling secondary indexes during the migration process will help. For more information on the AWS Schema Conversion Tool, see [AWS Schema Conversion Tool][31].

###[Migration Hub][32]

> AWS Migration Hub provides a single place to discover your existing servers, plan migrations, and track the status of each application migration. The AWS Migration Hub provides visibility into your application portfolio and streamlines planning and tracking. You can see the status of the servers and databases that make up each of the applications you are migrating regardless of which migration tool you are using.
> 
> AWS Migration Hub gives you the choice to start migrating right away and group servers while migration is underway, or to first discover servers and then group them into applications. Either way, you can migrate each server in an application and track progress from each tool in the AWS Migration Hub. It supports migration status updates from AWS Database Migration Service, AWS Server Migration Service, [CloudEndure Live Migration][33], and [Racemi DynaCenter][34]. For more information, see [Migration Tools][35].

###[Server Migration Service][36]

> AWS Server Migration Service automates the migration of your on-premises VMware server fleet to the AWS Cloud. AWS SMS incrementally replicates your server VMs as cloud-hosted Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) ready for deployment on Amazon EC2. Working with AMIs, you can easily test and update your cloud-based images before deploying them in production.

###[Schema Conversion Tool][37]

> You can use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to convert your existing database schema from one database engine to another. You can convert relational OLTP schema, or data warehouse schema. Your converted schema is suitable for an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) MySQL DB instance, an Amazon Aurora DB cluster, an Amazon RDS PostgreSQL DB instance, or an Amazon Redshift cluster.

###[CodeStar][38]

> AWS CodeStar is a cloud-based service for creating, managing, and working with software development projects on AWS. You can quickly develop, build, and deploy applications on AWS with an AWS CodeStar project. An AWS CodeStar project creates and integrates AWS services for your project development toolchain. Depending on your choice of AWS CodeStar project template, that toolchain might include source control, build, deployment, virtual servers or serverless resources, and more. AWS CodeStar also manages the permissions required for project users (called team members). By adding users as team members to an AWS CodeStar project, project owners can quickly and simply grant each team member role-appropriate access to a project and its resources.

###[CodeCommit][39]

> AWS CodeCommit is a version control service hosted by Amazon Web Services that you can use to privately store and manage assets (such as documents, source code, and binary files) in the cloud. For information about pricing for AWS CodeCommit, see [Pricing][40].

###[CodeBuild][41]

> AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. AWS CodeBuild compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy. AWS CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers. It provides prepackaged build environments for the most popular programming languages and build tools such as Apache Maven, Gradle, and more. You can also customize build environments in AWS CodeBuild to use your own build tools. AWS CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak build requests.

###[CodeDeploy][42]

> AWS CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployments to Amazon EC2 instances or on-premises instances in your own facility.
> 
> You can deploy a nearly unlimited variety of application content, such as code, web and configuration files, executables, packages, scripts, multimedia files, and so on. AWS CodeDeploy can deploy application content stored in Amazon S3 buckets, GitHub repositories, or Bitbucket repositories. You do not need to make changes to your existing code before you can use AWS CodeDeploy.
> 
> AWS CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features, helps you avoid downtime during application deployment, and handles the complexity of updating your applications, without many of the risks associated with error-prone manual deployments.
> 
> The service scales with your infrastructure so you can easily deploy to one instance or thousands.
> 
> AWS CodeDeploy works with various systems for configuration management, source control, [continuous integration][43], [continuous delivery][44], and continuous deployment. For more information, see [Product and Service Integrations][45].

###[CodePipeline][46]

> AWS CodePipeline is a continuous delivery service you can use to model, visualize, and automate the steps required to release your software. You can quickly model and configure the different stages of a software release process. AWS CodePipeline automates the steps required to release your software changes continuously. For information about pricing for AWS CodePipeline, see [Pricing][47].

In Amazon SNS, there are two types of clients—publishers and subscribers—also referred to as producers and consumers. Publishers communicate asynchronously with subscribers by producing and sending a message to a topic, which is a logical access point and communication channel. Subscribers (i.e., web servers, email addresses, Amazon SQS queues, AWS Lambda functions) consume or receive the message or notification over one of the supported protocols (i.e., Amazon SQS, HTTP/S, email, SMS, Lambda) when they are subscribed to the topic.

 ![此处输入图片的描述][108]

> When using Amazon SNS, you (as the owner) create a topic and control access to it by defining policies that determine which publishers and subscribers can communicate with the topic. A publisher sends messages to topics that they have created or to topics they have permission to publish to. Instead of including a specific destination address in each message, a publisher sends a message to the topic. Amazon SNS matches the topic to a list of subscribers who have subscribed to that topic, and delivers the message to each of those subscribers. Each topic has a unique name that identifies the Amazon SNS endpoint for publishers to post messages and subscribers to register for notifications. Subscribers receive all messages published to the topics to which they subscribe, and all subscribers to a topic receive the same messages.
